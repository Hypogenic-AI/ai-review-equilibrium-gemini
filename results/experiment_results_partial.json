Both Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 recognize the paper's novel contribution to the field of continual learning through the use of Generative Negative Replay, which I agree is a key strength. The approach of using imperfect generated data as negative examples is indeed practical and offers a new perspective on tackling catastrophic forgetting. While Reviewer 1 points out the lack of theoretical analysis and broader comparisons, I believe that the empirical evidence provided in the paper sufficiently demonstrates the method's effectiveness, which aligns with my initial assessment. Reviewer 2 mentions issues with clarity and comparative analysis, which I also noted in my initial review. However, these do not significantly detract from the overall contribution and potential impact of the work. Given the strong empirical results and novel approach, the paper warrants acceptance, but I maintain my original score as the concerns about clarity and comparative analysis remain relevant."
