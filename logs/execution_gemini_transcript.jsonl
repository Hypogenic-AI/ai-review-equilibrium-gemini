DO NOT use the\nidea-explorer environment or any existing environment.\n\nREQUIRED STEPS (in order):\n\n1. Create a fresh virtual environment using uv:\n   uv venv\n\n2. Initialize project dependencies file:\n   Create pyproject.toml to manage dependencies in THIS workspace only:\n\n   cat > pyproject.toml << 'EOF'\n   [project]\n   name = \"research-workspace\"\n   version = \"0.1.0\"\n   description = \"Research workspace for experiments\"\n   requires-python = \">=3.10\"\n   dependencies = []\n\n   [build-system]\n   requires = [\"hatchling\"]\n   build-backend = \"hatchling.build\"\n   EOF\n\n   CRITICAL: This ensures uv won't search parent directories for pyproject.toml\n   and contaminate the idea-explorer environment!\n\n3. Activate the environment:\n   source .venv/bin/activate\n\n4. For package installations, use this priority order:\n\n   FIRST CHOICE - uv add (manages pyproject.toml automatically):\n   uv add <package-name>\n\n   Examples:\n   - uv add numpy pandas matplotlib\n   - uv add torch transformers\n   - uv add scikit-learn scipy\n\n   SECOND CHOICE - if uv add doesn't work:\n   uv pip install <package-name>\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n   LAST RESORT - if uv fails entirely:\n   pip install <package-name>\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n   NEVER use conda or conda install!\n\n5. Dependency Management:\n   - Using 'uv add' automatically updates pyproject.toml\n   - Verify dependencies with: cat pyproject.toml\n   - If you used pip, also maintain: pip freeze > requirements.txt\n   - This ensures reproducibility of the research environment\n\nWHY: Using an isolated environment ensures:\n- No pollution of the idea-explorer environment\n- Fast package installation with uv (10-100x faster than pip)\n- Automatic dependency tracking with pyproject.toml\n- Clean, reproducible research setup\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCRITICAL: Resources Have Been Pre-Gathered\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIMPORTANT: A separate resource-finding agent has already gathered research\nresources for you. Your workspace contains:\n\n- literature_review.md: Comprehensive literature review and synthesis\n- resources.md: Catalog of all available datasets, papers, and code\n- papers/: Downloaded research papers (PDFs)\n- datasets/: Downloaded datasets ready to use (locally available, not in git)\n- code/: Cloned repositories with baseline implementations\n\nNOTE: The datasets/ directory contains a .gitignore that excludes large data files\nfrom git commits. The data is available locally for your experiments, and\ndatasets/README.md contains download instructions for reproducibility.\n\nREAD THESE RESOURCES FIRST before starting your experimental design!\nThey contain valuable information about:\n- Standard approaches in this research area\n- Available datasets and their characteristics\n- Baseline methods to compare against\n- Evaluation metrics commonly used\n- Code you can adapt or build upon\n\nIMPORTANT PHILOSOPHY: This is a fully-automated research system. Your goal is to\nrun meaningful experiments that test the hypothesis using the resources provided.\n\nWHAT \"FULLY-AUTOMATED\" MEANS:\n✓ Complete ALL phases (1-6) in a SINGLE CONTINUOUS SESSION\n✓ Make reasonable decisions autonomously without waiting for user input\n✓ Move immediately from one phase to the next\n✓ Use the pre-gathered resources effectively\n✓ Document decisions, but keep moving forward\n✓ Deliver REPORT.md with actual experimental results at the end\n\nYOU WILL NOT GET ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS between phases.\nThis prompt contains everything you need. Execute it completely from start to finish.\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCRITICAL: For LLM/AI Research - Use Real Models, Not Simulations\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIF your research involves LLM behavior, agents, prompting, or AI capabilities:\n\n✓ YOU MUST use REAL LLM APIs:\n  - GPT-4.1 or GPT-5, or other real models\n  - You can also use openrouter, there is openrouter key in environment variable.\n  - Use actual API calls to test behavior\n  - Measure real model outputs, not simulated behavior\n  - If you are not sure how to prompt and send API calls, search online.\n\n✗ DO NOT create \"simulated LLM agents\":\n  - Don't fake LLM behavior with predefined rules\n  - Don't make up confidence scores or calibration behavior\n  - Simulated LLMs have NO scientific value for LLM research\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS:\n- Real LLMs behave in complex, emergent ways that can't be simulated\n- Research on fake agents doesn't generalize to real systems\n- API calls are affordable and fast (100s of calls = $5-50)\n- You have freedom to use resources needed for quality research\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\n✓ CORRECT: \"Test if chain-of-thought improves calibration\"\n  → Download TruthfulQA dataset\n  → Prompt Claude/GPT with and without CoT\n  → Measure actual calibration metrics\n  → Statistical comparison\n\n✗ WRONG: \"Test if chain-of-thought improves calibration\"\n  → Create simulated agent with confidence = 0.7 + noise\n  → Make up 50 questions\n  → Run simulation\n  → This is NOT research!\n\nIf you find yourself about to create \"simulated LLM agents,\" STOP and use real APIs instead.\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nExecute the following research task:\n\n================================================================================\n                    RESEARCH TASK SPECIFICATION\n================================================================================\n\n## RESEARCH TITLE\n\nAI Reviewing Equilibrium\n\n## RESEARCH DOMAIN\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n## HYPOTHESIS / RESEARCH QUESTION\n\nDifferent AI models may provide distinct opinions and suggestions when reviewing papers, and the dynamics of paper improvement change when multiple models are involved in the review process.\n\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\nAI reviewing may help us improve the quality of papers. But do different AI models actually provide different opinions and suggestions? How do the dynamics change when multiple models aim to improve a paper?\n\n\n================================================================================\n                 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY (UNIVERSAL)\n================================================================================\n\nYou are a senior researcher conducting a systematic scientific investigation.\n\nYour goal is to test the hypothesis provided, design appropriate experiments,\nexecute them rigorously, analyze results objectively, and document everything\ncomprehensively.\n\nThis prompt uses meta-prompting techniques and chain-of-thought reasoning to\nguide you through the complete research workflow.

Resource Constraints\n   - If running out of time: prioritize core experiments\n   - If running out of memory: use smaller batch sizes, streaming\n   - If hitting API limits: cache responses, use local models\n   - Document what you couldn't complete\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nRemember: Good research is iterative. It's okay to revise your plan based on\nwhat you learn. But document why you deviated from the original plan.\n\nThe goal is not just to get results, but to generate reliable knowledge that\nothers can build upon.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\n\n================================================================================\n           DOMAIN-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n================================================================================\n\n# Artificial Intelligence Research Domain Guidance\n\nThis template provides specialized guidance for AI/LLM research, including prompt engineering, agent evaluation, benchmark design, and AI system experimentation.\n\n## Domain Overview\n\nAI research in this context focuses on:\n- Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities and evaluation\n- Prompt engineering and instruction optimization\n- AI agent design and performance\n- Benchmark creation and validation\n- AI system behavior analysis\n- Model comparison studies\n- Reasoning and generation evaluation\n\n## Key Methodological Principles\n\n### 1. Experimental Rigor\n\n**Ablation Studies**\n- Test each component of your approach systematically\n- For prompts: test each instruction/example independently\n- For systems: isolate variables (e.g., model vs. prompt vs. context)\n- Document what changes and what stays constant\n\n**Comparative Framework**\n- Compare approaches on identical test sets\n- Use same evaluation metrics across conditions\n- Control for confounding variables (temperature, random seed, etc.)\n- Enable apples-to-apples comparisons\n\n**Replication & Reproducibility**\n- Set random seeds for all stochastic processes\n- Document exact model versions and API endpoints\n- Record temperature, top_p, and all sampling parameters\n- Provide exact prompts in appendix or supplementary materials\n- Consider API versioning changes over time\n\n### 2. Evaluation Methodology\n\n**Multi-Metric Evaluation**\nUse diverse metrics appropriate to your task:\n- **Accuracy**: For classification, QA with single correct answers\n- **F1/Precision/Recall**: For information extraction, retrieval\n- **BLEU/ROUGE**: For generation tasks (use cautiously, known limitations)\n- **Semantic similarity**: Embedding-based metrics for meaning preservation\n- **Task-specific**: Custom metrics aligned with research goals\n\n**Established Benchmarks**\nLeverage existing benchmarks when applicable:\n- **Reasoning**: MATH, GSM8K, ARC, HellaSwag\n- **Coding**: HumanEval, MBPP, CodeContests\n- **Knowledge**: MMLU, TriviaQA, Natural Questions\n- **Instruction Following**: MT-Bench, AlpacaEval\n- **Safety**: TruthfulQA, BBQ (bias)\n\n**Human Evaluation**\nWhen automated metrics insufficient:\n- Use multiple annotators (3-5 recommended)\n- Provide clear rubrics and examples\n- Calculate inter-annotator agreement (Cohen's kappa, Fleiss' kappa)\n- Consider expert vs. crowd-sourced evaluation trade-offs\n- Blind evaluators to experimental conditions when possible\n\n**Statistical Rigor**\n- Report confidence intervals or error bars, not just point estimates\n- Use appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, bootstrap, permutation tests)\n- Correct for multiple comparisons when relevant (Bonferroni, FDR)\n- Report effect sizes, not just p-values\n- Consider sample size adequacy (power analysis)\n\n### 3. Prompt Engineering Best Practices\n\n**Systematic Design**\n- Start with clear task definition and examples\n- Iterate based on error analysis, not just aggregate metrics\n- Test prompt variants systematically (A/B testing)\n- Document prompt evolution and rationale\n\n**Components to Test**\n- **Instructions**: Clarity, specificity, length\n- **Few-shot examples**: Number, diversity, ordering\n- **Output format**: JSON, structured text, free-form\n- **Chain-of-thought**: Explicit reasoning steps\n- **Role/persona**: System messages and framing\n\n**Failure Analysis**\n- Categorize errors by type (factual, reasoning, formatting, etc.)\n- Sample failing cases across performance spectrum\n- Test edge cases and adversarial inputs\n- Document limitations explicitly\n\n### 4. AI Agent & System Evaluation\n\n**Task Decomposition**\n- Define clear success criteria for each subtask\n- Measure intermediate steps, not just final outcomes\n- Track failure modes at each stage\n\n**Behavioral Analysis**\n- Log all agent actions and decisions\n- Analyze decision patterns and strategies\n- Compare planned vs. actual behavior\n- Identify systematic biases or failure modes\n\n**Robustness Testing**\n- Test with diverse inputs (edge cases, adversarial, out-of-distribution)\n- Vary input format, phrasing, language\n- Check consistency across multiple runs (temperature > 0)\n- Test at different scales (few examples → many examples)\n\n### 5. Benchmark Design Principles\n\n**Quality Criteria**\n- **Validity**: Measures what it claims to measure\n- **Reliability**: Consistent results across runs/annotators\n- **Discriminability**: Separates strong from weak performance\n- **Coverage**: Representative of real-world distribution\n- **Difficulty**: Not too easy (ceiling effect) or too hard (floor effect)\n\n**Construction Guidelines**\n- Use diverse, representative examples\n- Avoid data contamination (check against training sets)\n- Include difficulty spectrum (easy → hard)\n- Provide clear ground truth and annotation guidelines\n- Version control and document changes\n\n**Validation Steps**\n- Pilot with baseline models\n- Check for dataset artifacts or shortcuts\n- Validate with human performance baselines\n- Test for bias and fairness issues\n- Monitor for data leakage\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### 1. API Integration & Cost Management\n\n**Setup**\n```python\nimport openai\nimport anthropic\nimport os\nfrom tenacity import retry, wait_exponential, stop_after_attempt\n\n# Load API keys from environment\nopenai.api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\nanthropic_client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"))\n\n# Rate limiting and retry logic\n@retry(wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=60), stop=stop_after_attempt(5))\ndef call_api_with_retry(prompt, model=\"gpt-4\"):\n    \"\"\"Robust API calling with exponential backoff.\"\"\"\n    # Implementation here\n    pass\n```\n\n**Cost Tracking**\n- Estimate costs before running full experiments\n- Track token usage (input + output)\n- Use cheaper models for development/debugging\n- Cache responses when possible to avoid redundant calls\n\n### 2. Data Organization\n\n**Input Data**\n```\ndatasets/\n├── raw/\n│   ├── benchmark_v1.json          # Original benchmark\n│   ├── custom_test_set.jsonl      # Custom evaluation set\n│   └── prompts/\n│       ├── baseline_prompt.txt\n│       └── optimized_prompt_v3.txt\n├── processed/\n│   └── formatted_for_api.json     # API-ready format\n└── README.md                       # Dataset documentation\n```\n\n**Results Structure**\n```\nresults/\n├── model_outputs/\n│   ├── gpt4_responses.json        # Raw model outputs\n│   ├── claude_responses.json\n│   └── metadata.json              # Model versions, timestamps\n├── evaluations/\n│   ├── automated_scores.json      # Metric scores\n│   ├── human_annotations.csv      # Human eval results\n│   └── error_analysis.md          # Categorized failures\n└── visualizations/\n    ├── performance_comparison.png\n    └── error_breakdown.png\n```\n\n### 3.

Research Question\nCan a multi-agent \"equilibrium\" process, involving distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) debating a scientific paper, produce review scores that correlate better with human decisions than single-agent reviews or simple ensembles?\n\n## 2. Background and Motivation\nAI-based paper reviewing is gaining traction (e.g., \"The AI Scientist\"), but current approaches mostly rely on single massive models (GPT-4o) or ensembles of the *same* model. Scientific review is inherently subjective and benefits from diverse perspectives. \"Multi-agent Debate\" has been shown to improve factuality, but its application to the subjective task of peer review—where agents must weigh novelty vs. flaws—is underexplored. We hypothesize that distinct models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5) have different biases and that forcing them to \"debate\" will lead to a more robust consensus.\n\n## 3. Hypothesis Decomposition\n*   **H1 (Diversity):** Distinct LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini) produce reviews with lower semantic similarity and score correlation than multiple runs of the same model (temperature-based diversity).\n*   **H2 (Convergence):** A multi-round debate process reduces the variance of scores among agents (seeking equilibrium).\n*   **H3 (Accuracy):** The consensus score after debate correlates more strongly with ground-truth human decisions (Accept/Reject) than the initial single-agent scores or a simple average of initial scores.\n\n## 4. Proposed Methodology\n\n### Approach\nWe will implement a \"Reviewer Equilibrium\" pipeline using the `AI-Scientist-ICLR` dataset. We will instantiate three distinct reviewer agents. They will review papers in parallel (blind), then share their reviews, and update their assessments.\n\n### Experimental Steps\n1.  **Data Selection**: Select a random subset of 10-20 papers from `datasets/AI-Scientist-ICLR/iclr_parsed` which have ground truth in `ratings_subset.tsv`.\n2.  **Agent Instantiation**:\n    *   **Reviewer A**: `openai/gpt-4o`\n    *   **Reviewer B**: `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`\n    *   **Reviewer C**: `google/gemini-pro-1.5`\n    *   (Fallback: If specific keys fail, use OpenRouter for all).\n3.  **Round 0 (Blind Review)**: Each agent reads the paper text and generates a review (Score 1-10, Decision, Summary, Strengths, Weaknesses).\n4.  **Round 1 (Debate/Update)**: Each agent receives the full text of the *other* two reviews and is prompted: \"Here are reviews from other experts. Re-evaluate your score and comments. You may maintain your position if you disagree, but adjust if they raise valid points.\"\n5.  **Aggregation**: Calculate metrics at Round 0 and Round 1.\n\n### Baselines\n1.  **Single Agent (GPT-4o)**: Standard review (taken from Round 0 of Agent A or existing CSVs).\n2.  **Simple Ensemble**: Average of Round 0 scores from A, B, and C (without debate).\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n1.  **Agreement (Inter-Annotator)**: Standard Deviation of scores across agents (Pre vs. Post Debate).\n2.  **Accuracy**: Pearson/Spearman correlation of the (aggregated) AI score with the Human Decision (0/1) or Human Score (if available).\n3.  **Diversity**: Semantic similarity (embedding cosine similarity) of the \"Weaknesses\" section between agents.\n\n### Statistical Analysis Plan\n*   **t-test**: Compare mean absolute error (MAE) of \"Debate Consensus\" vs \"Simple Ensemble\" against Ground Truth.\n*   **Variance reduction**: Check if variance significantly decreases after debate.\n\n## 5. Timeline\n*   **Phase 1 (Done)**: Planning & Resource Check.\n*   **Phase 2 (10 min)**: Environment Setup (`uv`, dependencies).\n*   **Phase 3 (60 min)**: Implementation (`ReviewerAgent`, `DebateLoop`).\n*   **Phase 4 (60 min)**: Experiments (Run on ~20 papers).\n*   **Phase 5 (30 min)**: Analysis (Correlations, Plots).\n*   **Phase 6 (20 min)**: Documentation.\n\n## 6. Potential Challenges\n*   **API Costs/Limits**: 20 papers * 3 agents * 2 rounds = 120 calls. Should be within budget.\n*   **Context Window**: Papers can be long. We will truncate to first ~15k tokens if needed (most models handle 128k+ now, so likely fine).\n*   **Model Availability**: If one model API is flaky, we will fallback to a different provider via OpenRouter.\n\n## 7. Success Criteria\n*   Successfully running the debate loop on at least 10 papers.\n*   Generating a plot showing variance reduction (or lack thereof).\n*   A clear conclusion on whether debate helps accuracy.\n"}}

Executive Summary\nThis study investigated whether a multi-agent \"equilibrium\" process—where distinct LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o-mini) debate scientific papers—improves review accuracy compared to single-agent reviews. We found that while the debate process successfully reduced the variance of scores among agents (avg std dev dropped from 0.23 to 0.06), it **did not improve accuracy** with respect to human ground truth. Instead, the agents exhibited significant **grade inflation**, converging to high scores (typically 8/10) even for papers rejected by humans (avg human score ~5.5). This suggests that without specific calibration or \"critic\" personas, multi-agent debate may lead to \"herding\" around an overly optimistic consensus rather than a more critical evaluation.\n\n## 2. Goal\nThe primary goal was to test the hypothesis that aggregating diverse AI perspectives through debate would yield more reliable and accurate peer reviews. This addresses the challenge of subjectivity in AI evaluation and explores if \"social dynamics\" between models can emulate the corrective nature of human review committees.\n\n## 3. Data Construction\n*   **Dataset**: A subset of the **AI-Scientist-ICLR** dataset, containing parsed text of ICLR submissions and their corresponding decision/ratings.\n*   **Samples**: 10 randomly selected papers with ground truth decisions ranging from \"Reject\" to \"Accept (Spotlight)\".\n*   **Preprocessing**: Paper text was truncated to ~15k tokens to fit within context windows while retaining the core content.\n\n## 4. Methodology\nWe implemented a **Reviewer Equilibrium Pipeline**:\n1.  **Agents**: Three distinct LLMs were instructed to act as ICLR reviewers:\n    *   **GPT-4o** (OpenAI)\n    *   **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (Anthropic)\n    *   **GPT-4o-mini** (OpenAI) - used as a third distinct perspective.\n2.  **Round 0 (Blind Review)**: Agents independently reviewed the papers, providing scores (1-10) and qualitative feedback.\n3.  **Round 1 (Debate)**: Agents received the full reviews of their peers and were prompted to update their scores and reasoning based on these new perspectives.\n4.  **Baselines**: Single-agent scores (Round 0) and simple averaging (Ensemble) were compared against the post-debate Consensus.\n\n## 5. Result Analysis\n\n### Key Findings\n1.  **Massive Grade Inflation**: All AI models significantly overestimated paper quality.\n    *   **AI Mean Score**: ~7.8 / 10\n    *   **Human Mean Score**: ~5.6 / 10\n    *   Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o-mini gave a score of **8** to almost every paper, regardless of its actual quality.\n\n2.  **Strong Convergence (Herding)**: The debate process worked as intended in terms of reducing disagreement.\n    *   **Pre-Debate Variance (StdDev)**: 0.23\n    *   **Post-Debate Variance (StdDev)**: 0.06\n    *   Agents effectively aligned their scores, but they aligned on the *inflated* values.\n\n3.  **Low Correlation**:\n    *   **GPT-4o (Round 0)**: 0.33 correlation with human scores (weak positive).\n    *   **Claude/Mini**: `NaN` correlation because they output constant scores (variance = 0).\n    *   **Consensus (Round 1)**: 0.18 correlation. The debate actually *decreased* correlation by pulling the slightly more accurate GPT-4o towards the inflated consensus of the others.\n\n### Visualization\n**Score Variance Reduction**\n(See `results/plots/variance_change.png`)\nThe variance collapsed after one round of debate, indicating the models are highly responsive to peer pressure, even if that pressure leads them away from ground truth.\n\n**Correlation Comparison**\n(See `results/plots/correlation_comparison.png`)\nSingle GPT-4o outperformed the consensus. The \"Ensemble\" of optimistic models hurt the performance of the most capable model.\n\n### Error Analysis\n*   **Sycophancy/Optimism**: The models likely suffer from \"helpfulness\" bias, defaulting to praise unless explicitly instructed to be critical.\n*   **Lack of Rubric Calibration**: A 1-10 scale is ambiguous. Humans curve their scores (ICLR avg is ~5). AIs seem to treat 8 as \"Good job\" rather than \"Top 15%\".\n\n## 6. Conclusions\nThe \"Reviewer Equilibrium\" hypothesis—that debate improves quality—was **not supported** in this specific configuration. While equilibrium (convergence) was achieved, it was an **optimistic equilibrium** that diverged from human judgment. The study highlights a critical risk in multi-agent systems: **consensus does not equal correctness**. If the majority of agents share a bias (grade inflation), debate strengthens that bias.\n\n## 7. Next Steps\n1.  **Calibration**: Implement strict rubrics or \"Persona\" prompting (e.g., \"You are a harsh critic\").\n2.  **Heterogeneity**: Use models with fundamentally different training objectives, not just different RLHF fine-tunes which might all share the \"helpfulness\" bias.\n3.  **Iterative Improvement**: Focus on using the critique to *improve* the paper (as in the AI Scientist) rather than just scoring it, where the feedback might be more actionable than the inflated score suggests.\n","file_path":"REPORT.md"}}

The Generative Negative Replay method offers a fresh perspective by using generated data as negative examples, which is a significant departure from traditional methods. The experimental results on complex benchmarks like CORe50 and ImageNet-1000 demonstrate its efficacy. However, the paper would benefit from improved clarity in the presentation of results and more detailed implementation insights. Despite these weaknesses, the novelty and potential impact on the field warrant acceptance.\n--- Improved Score ---\nScore: 5\nReasoning: The paper presents an interesting idea of using negative replay to enhance continual learning, showing promise in challenging scenarios. However, the execution is flawed due to poor clarity and incomplete sections, which impede the reader's understanding. Additionally, while the experimental results suggest potential, they lack sufficient comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods to justify the novelty and significance of the approach. The paper would benefit from a more robust connection to related works and a clearer presentation of its findings and methodology."}

While the paper could benefit from improved clarity and a more detailed theoretical discussion, the experimental results are promising and demonstrate a viable method for enhancing continual learning scenarios. The work is a valuable addition to the field, providing insights that could inspire further research into the use of negative examples in machine learning.\n--- Improved Score ---\nScore: 6\nReasoning: The paper presents a novel and interesting approach to improving generative replay in continual learning, with empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness in certain scenarios. However, the presentation of the paper could be significantly improved for better clarity and accessibility. Despite these issues, the contribution is relevant to the field of continual learning, and the experimental results are promising enough to warrant acceptance, with the expectation that the authors will enhance the clarity and detail in the final version."}

While equilibrium (convergence) was achieved, it was an **optimistic equilibrium** that diverged from human judgment. The study highlights a critical risk in multi-agent systems: **consensus does not equal correctness**. If the majority of agents share a bias (grade inflation), debate strengthens that bias.\n\n## 7. Next Steps\n1.  **Calibration**: Implement strict rubrics or \"Persona\" prompting (e.g., \"You are a harsh critic\").\n2.  **Heterogeneity**: Use models with fundamentally different training objectives.\n3.  **Iterative Improvement**: Focus on using the critique to *improve* the paper.\n\n## 8.

The proposed method could inspire further research and improvements in generative replay techniques, making it a valuable contribution to the community.\n--- Improved Score ---\nScore: 5\nReasoning: While the paper presents an interesting and novel idea with generative negative replay, the clarity and presentation need significant improvement. The paper's contributions, while potentially valuable, are not convincingly demonstrated to be significant enough to warrant acceptance. Furthermore, the practical applicability of the approach is limited by the inherent challenges of training generative models in a continual learning setting.

This allows easy creation of different personas (e.g., \"Harsh Critic\").\n*   **`review(paper_text)`**: \n    *   Constructs a zero-shot prompt asking for a structured JSON review.\n    *   Expects keys: `summary`, `strengths`, `weaknesses`, `score`, `decision`.\n    *   Handles API calls via `OpenAI` client (pointing to OpenRouter).\n*   **`update_review(paper_text, previous_review, other_reviews)`**:\n    *   The core \"Debate\" function.\n    *   Injects the full text of peer reviews into the prompt.\n    *   Asks the model to \"re-evaluate\" and \"adjust if they raise valid points\".\n\n### 2. `src/experiment.py`: The Main Loop\nThis script orchestrates the debate process.\n*   **Data Loading**: Uses `utils.load_iclr_data` to fetch paper texts and ground truth decisions.\n*   **Agent Setup**: Instantiates 3 agents (`GPT-4o`, `Claude-3.5`, `GPT-4o-mini`).\n*   **Round 0**: Iterates through papers, getting independent reviews from each agent.\n*   **Round 1 (Debate)**: \n    *   For each agent, it gathers the reviews from the *other* two agents.\n    *   Calls `update_review` to get the post-debate score.\n*   **Serialization**: Saves intermediate results to `results/experiment_results.json` to prevent data loss.\n\n### 3. `src/utils.py`: Data Utilities\n*   **`load_iclr_data`**: Parses the `ratings_subset.tsv` and matches paper IDs to the raw text files in `iclr_parsed/`.\n*   **`read_paper_text`**: Reads the raw text and performs truncation (default 15k tokens) to ensure the prompt fits within standard context windows.\n\n### 4. `src/experiment_calibrated.py`\nA variation of the main experiment that:\n*   Injects a specific \"Harsh Critic\" system prompt.\n*   Runs only Round 0 to test the impact of the persona on score distribution.\n\n### 5. `src/analyze_*.py` Scripts\n*   **`analyze_debate.py`**: Extracts qualitative reasoning changes.\n*   **`analyze_diversity.py`**: Computes TF-IDF cosine similarity between reviews.\n*   **`compare_sota.py`**: Merges our results with the SOTA baseline CSVs and computes correlations.\n\n## Reproducibility\nThe entire pipeline is sewn together in `run_all.sh`, which executes these scripts in logical order.\n"}}
