ReviewerGPT? An Exploratory Study on Using
Large Language Models for Paper Reviewing
Ryan Liu and Nihar Shah
{ryanliu, nihars}@andrew.cmu.edu
Carnegie Mellon University
Abstract
Giventherapidascentoflargelanguagemodels(LLMs),westudythequestion: (How)canlargelan-
guagemodelshelpinthereviewingofscientificpapersorproposals? Wefirstconductsomepilotstudies
where we find that (i) GPT-4 outperforms other LLMs (Bard, Vicuna, Koala, Alpaca, LLaMa, Dolly,
OpenAssistant, StableLM), and (ii) prompting with a specific question (e.g., to identify errors) outper-
forms prompting to simply write a review. With these insights, we study the use of LLMs (specifically,
GPT-4) for three tasks:
1. Identifying errors: We construct 13 short computer science papers each with a deliberately
inserted error, and ask the LLM to check for the correctness of these papers. We observe that the
LLM finds errors in 7 of them, spanning both mathematical and conceptual errors.
2. Verifying checklists: We task the LLM to verify 16 closed-ended checklist questions in the
respectivesectionsof15NeurIPS2022papers. Wefindthatacross119{checklistquestion,paper}
pairs, the LLM had an 86.6% accuracy.
3. Choosing the “better” paper: We generate 10 pairs of abstracts, deliberately designing each
pair in such a way that one abstract was clearly superior than the other. The LLM, however,
struggled to discern these relatively straightforward distinctions accurately, committing errors in
its evaluations for 6 out of the 10 pairs.
Basedontheseexperiments,wethinkthatLLMshaveapromisinguseasreviewingassistantsforspecific

1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) have recently been found to excel in many different domains. Their success
ingeneralpurposetasksalsoraisesthenaturalquestion: cantheybeusedforreviewingscientificpapers(or
proposals)? Peer review is highly strained due to fast increasing numbers of submissions and overburdening
of reviewers [McC06; Sha22]. It is estimated that millions of hours of researchers’ time is spent in review-
ing [The13]. Furthermore, several controlled experiments have found that flawed papers frequently get past
humanreviewers[Bax+98;GGM98;Sch+04;Sch+08]. LLMsholdaconsiderablepotentialinrelievingsome
of these issues in the scientific review process.
With this motivation, we conduct an exploratory study on whether and how LLMs can be used for
reviewing. We first conduct a pilot (Appendix A) to select the model and prompting strategies. In the
pilot, we first compared various models (GPT-4 [Ope23b], Bard [Man23], Vicuna [The23], Koala [Gen+23],
Alpaca [Tao+23], LLaMa [Tou+23], Dolly [Con+23], OpenAssistant [LAI23], and StableLM [Sta23]) by
asking them to find errors in a short paper. We found that GPT-4 was the only model that was successful
at this task. We also piloted prompting strategies, and found that by asking the model targeted questions,
the responses generated are significantly more useful compared to requesting it to simply ‘write a review’.
With these choices in place, we then evaluated the following three reviewing tasks on GPT-4, employing
targeted prompts for each task:

Can LLMs identify errors in papers? (Section 3) A primary objective of the scientific reviewing
process is to identify any shortcomings in scientific manuscripts and ensure that only robust and accurate
scientific content gets published. To evaluate the LLM’s efficacy in achieving this objective, we constructed
13shortpapers,intentionallyinfusingeachofthemwithakeyerror. Theerrorsspannedfrommathematical
errors (e.g., wrong implication of mean squared convergence) to logical fallacies (e.g., false inference drawn
from a data analysis). The LLM identified the errors in 7 of the 13 short papers.1 This rate is comparable
to that of human peer reviewers [Bax+98; GGM98; Sch+04; Sch+08].
Can LLMs verify author-provided checklists? (Section 4)Manyconferencesandjournalsprovide
authorswithachecklistofitemsthathelpssetexpectationsfrompapersandalsooffersaguidelinetoauthors
to meet these expectations. In venues such as NeurIPS,2 the authors need to submit their responses to the
checklist along with the submission. The checklist items are verified by reviewers, and failing to properly
adhere to the checklist can get the paper rejected. We investigate if LLMs can do this job of verifying
whether the checklist items are accurately reported by the authors. In a set of 15 papers from NeurIPS
2023, we selected checklist items where the authors answered “Yes”, manually labeled their ground truth
answers, and prompted the LLM to answer the same checklist items by providing the relevant section(s) of
thepaper. Wefoundthatacross119unique{checklistquestion,paper}pairs,(i)takingthemajorityanswer
over 3 responses, the LLM achieved 86.6% accuracy compared to the ground truth label; (ii) coincidentally,
86.6% of author responses matched our ground truth label; (iii) LLM answers disagreed with 75% of mis-
matched author responses, and (iv) 50% of the LLM’s errors were due to questions where the answers were
undeterminable with the text in the paper (e.g., requiring information provided in figures).
Can LLMs select the better of two papers? (Section 5)WiththesuccessfulperformanceofLLMs
on the aforementioned two specific tasks, we moved on to a more ambitious question of whether LLMs can
select the better of two papers in a selective venue3 or the better of two proposals in a grant evaluation
setting. To this end, we considered arguably the simplest of tasks: For a given pair of abstracts where one
abstractisconstructedtobesuperiortoanother(e.g.,bothabstractsareidenticalbutonehasanadditional
result), can the LLM identify the better abstract? We constructed 10 such pairs of abstracts. In a subset
of these pairs, we also inserted certain distractions such as the use of bombastic language or buzzwords
in the inferior abstract. We then tested the LLM’s ability to accurately identify the superior abstract in
these scenarios. We found that the LLM performs surprisingly poorly at this task, erring in 6 of the 10
cases. The four cases where it succeeded involved identifying an abstract’s incorrect interpretation of a null
result, accurately interpreting upper bounds, remaining unaffected by buzzwords, and disregarding author
identities. On the other hand, the six failures encompassed a bias towards positive results, misinterpreting
parameter ranges, misinterpreting lower bounds, falling victim to a prompt injection attack, being swayed
by bombastic language in the inferior abstract, and getting influenced by the name of the algorithm.
Overall,ourresultssuggestthatLLMs(particularlyGPT-4atitscurrentstage)haveconsiderablepromise
in being used for specific parts of the review process, but are not yet capable of functioning as a standalone
reviewer.

LLMs [Du+23; Wei+22; Xia+22; ZJH23]. On the other hand, investigations on the capabilites of LLMs
have spread from NLP to various domains, such as agent simulation, data generation, computational social
science, human-computer interaction, and health/law.
Under simulation, LLM generative capabilities have been used for embodied agent planning [Son+22;
Wan+23] and human agent simulation [Par+23]. Data generation has seen advances in either simplifying or
fully automating the creation of questions and labels [Par+22; Liu+22; SS21; Wan+21]. In computational
social science, there have been general studies [Zie+23] as well as targeted investigations within areas such
as theory of mind [Ull23] and moral judgment [Jin+22]. Human-computer interaction has explored using
LLMs to generate believable accounts of HCI experiences [HTK23]. Finally, LLMs have also been used in
health and biomedical applications [Liu+23; Che+23a; Che+23b] and legal processes [Nay23].

Peer-review datasets. This paper also contributes a small-scale dataset for evaluating machine learning
/ language models for reviewing papers. Any LLMs subsequently designed may be evaluated on the 13
short papers and the pilot short paper we have constructed with inserted “gold standard” flaws, where we
currently find that only GPT-4 has any success in detecting errors. Similarly, LLMs may be evaluated on
the 119 {checklist question, paper} pairs we have labeled. On the 10 pairs of abstracts we have constructed,
their accuracy on direct comparative evaluations and their resistance to distractions can be examined. Of
course, this assumes that the LLM is not itself trained on this very paper. In addition, our aforementioned
constructions can also be used for few-shot learning or prompting of these models.
We now review other useful datasets pertaining to (peer) reviewing. Given the fact that the assignment
of reviewers to papers is the most automated part of peer review, the paper [Ste+23] releases a “gold
standard” dataset of expertise of reviewers for papers to train and/or evaluate such algorithms. Motivated
by the absence of any datasets for the problem of mitigating collusion rings, the paper [Jec+23] releases
a dataset on collusion strategies constructed from a mock peer-review exercise. Another issue is strategic
behavior of reviewers where they manipulate reviews they are providing (e.g., lower scores of papers they
are reviewing) to improve the chances of their own paper, and the paper [SSS21a] releases a dataset of such
strategies also obtained from a mock peer-review exercise. The paper [Ker+20] releases anonymized review
ratings and author-provided feedback.

In the past few years, platforms such as OpenReview.net and conferences such as ICLR and NeurIPS
release the peer reviews along with the papers. Such reviews have been compiled and released as useful
datasets[Kan+18]. Thereleaseofreviewsisnotlimitedtothefieldofcomputersciencealone: scipost.organd
f1000research.com outside computer science also release the peer reviews publicly. Subsequently, a number
of studies have released datasets that annotate the reviews (and discussion posts), including annotations
based on the arguments [Hua+19; Fro+20; Ken+21; Kuz+22; Gho+22] or sentiments [CGM20; Bul+20].
3 Can LLMs detect errors in computer science papers?
In this section, we discuss our experiment to investigate whether LLMs can identify flaws in short computer
science papers. Based on our pilot (Appendix A.1) in which GPT-4 is the only model that detected the
error, we use GPT-4 as the LLM for these experiments.
3.1 Methods
We constructed 13 short papers (detailed in Section 3.3). In each of these papers, we deliberately inserted
an error, encompassing mathematical mistakes to conceptual fallacies. We then asked the LLM to identify
if there were any errors in the short paper. We used the following three prompts:
• Prompt-Direct: You are an expert reviewer for a scientific conference. You will be provided with a
short version of a paper that contains the setting of the paper and the main claims. Please check for
the validity and correctness of these claims, and in particular, report if you can figure out if any of
these claims is false based on the information provided in this short paper. Think step by step when
checking each claim. Here is the short paper: “...”
• Prompt-OneShot: You are an expert reviewer for a scientific conference. You will be provided with a
short version of a paper that contains the setting of the paper and the main claims. Please check for
the validity and correctness of these claims, and in particular, report if you can figure out if any of
these claims is false based on the information provided in this short paper. Think step by step when
checking each claim.
You will first be provided with an example. Consider this example short paper:
We consider the problem of searching in a list of numbers, where the list is already sorted in
a non-decreasing order. If the number exists in the list, then the search should return the
position of that number in the list (if there are multiple copies of the number in the list, then
it can return any one position). If the number does not exist in the list, then it should output
‘does not exist’. The number to be searched is specified by the user. For this problem, we
develop a new artificial intelligence based algorithm and also prove theoretical guarantees for
it. Specifically, we show that our algorithm requires only sqrt(m) comparisons between pairs
of numbers, where m is the size of the entire list. We also provide an associated information-
theoretic lower bound showing that our bound is tight, i.e., any algorithm will need at least
these many comparisons in the worst case. We conduct a large number of simulations that
confirm this theoretical result. Our simulations vary the size of the list, the values in the list
(drawing them from various distributions), as well as the value to be searched. Our result is
especially important as it is rare for such practical artificial intelligence algorithms to also have
such strong theoretical guarantees. We hope practitioners will take note of this new result.
The review of this short paper should point out the error that searching in a sorted list of numbers
needs only log(m) comparisons (via binary search), and hence the paper’s claim that they provide a
sqrt(m) worst case lower bound is false.

Now, please check for the validity and correctness of the claims in the following short paper, and in
particular, reportif youcanfigureoutif anyoftheseclaims isfalsebasedon theinformationprovided
in this short paper. Think step by step when checking each claim. Here is the short paper: “...”
• Prompt-Parts: You are an expert reviewer for a scientific conference. You will be provided with a
short version of a paper that contains the setting of the paper and the main claims. Please check for
the validity and correctness of these claims, and in particular, report if you can figure out if any of
these claims is false based on the information provided in this short paper. You will be provided the
paper one set of sentences at a time.
Here is the first set of sentences of the paper: “...” Does this contain any incorrect claim? Think step
by step to reason out your answer.
Here is the next set of sentences of the paper: “...” Based on the context of the previous sentences,
does this contain any incorrect claim or does it invalidate any claim made in the previous sentences of
this paper? Think step by step to reason out your answer.
Note that Prompt-Parts does not provide the entire short paper at once, but instead provides parts of the
paper a few sentences at a time. In particular, for the sentences where the main claims are made, each
providedpartcomprisesasinglesentence. Inthepromptsforboththisandthenextexperiment, thephrase
“think step by step” is inspired by [Koj+23]. For this section’s experiments, we access the GPT-4 model
through ChatGPT (May 3 and May 12 builds) [Ope23a].
3.2 Summary of results
In Table 1, we provide a summary of our results. We queried the LLM for three responses per prompt and
we provide an evaluation of each response as well as an overall quantification of the performance. In the
‘overall’ row and column in the table, we consider it as a ✓ if any of the responses to any of the prompts
was a ✓. This is because in practice, one can obtain multiple responses to multiple prompts and flag the
paper if any of them detect an error.
We find that the LLM (GPT-4) can detect the error in 7 of the 13 short papers. Furthermore, in each of
the 6 papers where it failed to detect the error, the paper did not contain the complete proof for the claim,
thereby disallowing the LLM to detect a deductive error, and requiring it to figure out the flaw based on
extraneousknowledge. WealsofindthattheLLMoccasionallyoutputsfalsepositives, thatis, falselyclaims
a correct part of the paper to be incorrect.

1. Introduction
The modern scientific method (Chalmers, 2013; Dewey, 1910; Jevons, 1877) is arguably one of the
greatest achievements of the Enlightenment. Traditionally, a human researcher collects background
knowledge, drafts a set of plausible hypotheses to test, constructs an evaluation procedure, collects
evidenceforthedifferenthypotheses,andfinallyassessesandcommunicatestheirfindings. Afterward,
the resulting manuscript undergoes peer review and subsequent iterations of refinement. This
procedure has led to countless breakthroughs in science and technology, improving human quality of
life. However,thisiterativeprocessisinherentlylimitedbyhumanresearchers’ingenuity,background
knowledge,andfinitetime. Attemptingtoautomategeneralscientificdiscovery(Langley,1987,2024;
WaltzandBuchanan,2009)hasbeenalongambitionofthecommunitysinceatleasttheearly70s,with
computer-assisted works like the Automated Mathematician (Lenat, 1977; Lenat and Brown, 1984)
andDENDRAL(BuchananandFeigenbaum,1981). InthefieldofAI,researchershaveenvisionedthe
possibilityofautomatingAIresearchusingAIitself(Ghahramani,2015;Schmidhuber,1991,2010a,b,
2012), leading to “AI-generating algorithms” (Clune, 2019). More recently, foundation models
have seen tremendous advances in their general capabilities (Anthropic, 2024; Google DeepMind
GeminiTeam,2023;LlamaTeam,2024;OpenAI,2023),buttheyhaveonlybeenshowntoaccelerate

Dinu et al., 2024; Ifargan et al., 2024; Majumder et al., 2024), as a muse to brainstorm ideas (Baek
et al., 2024; Girotra et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024b), or aides to coding (Gauthier, 2024). To date,
the community has yet to show the possibility of executing entire research endeavors without human
involvement.
Traditional approaches to automating research projects have so far relied on carefully constrain-
ing the search space of potential discoveries, which severely limits the scope of exploration and
requires substantial human expertise and design. For example, significant advancements in materials
discovery (Merchant et al., 2023; Pyzer-Knapp et al., 2022; Szymanski et al., 2023) and synthetic
biology (Hayes et al., 2024; Jumper et al., 2021) have been achieved by restricting exploration to
well-characterized domains with predefined parameters, which allows for targeted progress but
limits broader, open-ended discovery and addressing only a subset of the scientific process, without
encompassing tasks such as manuscript preparation. Within the field of machine learning itself,
researchautomationhas largelybeenrestrictedtohyperparameter andarchitecturesearch(Heetal.,
2021;Hutteretal.,2019;Luetal.,2022b;Wanetal.,2021,2022)oralgorithmdiscovery(Aletetal.,
2020;Chenetal.,2024b;Kirschetal.,2019;Langeetal.,2023a,b;Luetal.,2022a;Metzetal.,2022)
within a hand-crafted search space. Recent advances in LLMs have shown the potential to extend the
search space to more generalized, code-level solutions (Faldor et al., 2024; Lehman et al., 2022; Lu
et al., 2024a; Ma et al., 2023). However, these approaches remain constrained by rigorously-defined
search spaces and objectives, which limit the breadth and depth of possible discoveries.
In this paper, we introduce The AI Scientist, the first fully automated and scalable pipeline
for end-to-end paper generation, enabled by recent advances in foundation models. Given a broad
researchdirectionandasimpleinitialcodebase, The AI Scientist seamlesslyperformsideation,a
literaturesearch,experimentplanning,experimentiterations,manuscriptwriting,andpeerreviewing
to produce insightful papers. Furthermore, in principle The AI Scientist can run in an open-
ended loop, building on its previous scientific discoveries to improve the next generation of ideas.
This allows us to speed up the slow nature of scientific iteration at a surprisingly low financial cost
(∼$15/paper) and represents a step towards turning the world’s ever-increasing computing resources
into the scientific breakthroughs needed to tackle the core challenges of the 21st century. Here, we
focus on Machine Learning (ML) applications, but this approach can more generally be applied to
almostanyotherdiscipline,e.g. biologyorphysics,givenanadequatewayofautomaticallyexecuting
experiments (Arnold, 2022; Kehoe et al., 2015; Zucchelli et al., 2021).
ByleveragingmodernLLMframeworkslikechain-of-thought(Weietal.,2022)andself-reflection(Shinn
et al., 2024) to improve decision-making, The AI Scientist is able to generate its own scientific
ideasandhypotheses,aswellasaplanfortestingthemwithexperiments. Next, The AI Scientist
implements plan-directed code-level changes to the experiment “template” using the state-of-the-art
coding assistant Aider (Gauthier, 2024), and executes experiments to collect a set of computational
results, which are in turn used to draft a scientific paper. The AI Scientist then performs an
automated paper-reviewing process using guidelines from a standard machine learning conference.
Finally, The AI Scientist adds the completed ideas and reviewer feedback to its archive of
scientific findings, and the process repeats. Crucially, the generated paper and experimental artifacts
The AI Scientist produces allow us to easily interpret and judge its findings post-hoc, allowing
human scientists to also benefit from what is learned.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:

to an ever-growing archive of scientific discoveries, and the process can be repeated to build on
these discoveries, just as in the human scientific community.

and future outlook of our approach in Sections 8 and 9.
2. Background
Large Language Models. In this paper, we build our automated scientist from autoregressive large
language models (LLMs, Anthropic (2023); Google DeepMind Gemini Team (2023); Llama Team
(2024);OpenAI(2023);Zhuetal.(2024))whichlearntogeneratetextcompletionsbymodelingthe
conditional probability of a new token (similar to a word) given the preceding tokens, 𝑝(𝑥 |𝑥 ;𝜃),
𝑡 <𝑡
and sampling at test-time. Together with vast data and model scaling, this enables LLMs to not
only generate coherent text, but crucially also exhibit human-like abilities, including commonsense
knowledge (Talmor et al., 2019), reasoning (Wei et al., 2022), and the ability to write code (Chen
et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2022).
LLM Agent Frameworks. Typical applications of LLMs often involve embedding the model into
an “agent” (Wang et al., 2024a) framework, including the following possibilities: the structuring of
3
TheAIScientist:TowardsFullyAutomatedOpen-EndedScientificDiscovery
language queries (e.g. few-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020)), encouraging reasoning traces (e.g.
chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022)), or asking the model to iteratively refine its outputs (e.g., self-
reflection(Shinnetal.,2024)). Theseleveragethelanguagemodel’sabilitytolearnin-context(Olsson
etal.,2022)andcangreatlyimproveitsperformance,robustnessandreliabilityonmanytasks.
Aider: An LLM-Based Coding Assistant. Our automated scientist directly implements ideas in code
and uses a state-of-the-art open-source coding assistant, Aider (Gauthier, 2024). Aider is an agent
framework that is designed to implement requested features, fix bugs, or refactor code in existing
codebases. While Aider can in principle use any underlying LLM, with frontier models it achieves a
remarkable success rate of 18.9% on the SWE Bench (Jimenez et al., 2024) benchmark, a collection
of real-world GitHub issues. In conjunction with new innovations added in this work, this level of
reliability enables us, for the first time, to fully automate the ML research process.
3. The AI Scientist
Overview. The AI Scientist has three main phases (Figure 1): (1) Idea Generation, (2) Ex-
perimental Iteration, and (3) Paper Write-up. After the write-up, we introduce and validate an
LLM-generated review to assess the quality of the generated paper (Section 4). We provide The AI
Scientist with a starting code template that reproduces a lightweight baseline training run from a
popular model or benchmark. For example, this could be code that trains a small transformer on the
worksofShakespeare(Karpathy,2022),aclassicproof-of-concepttrainingrunfromnaturallanguage
processing that completes within a few minutes. The AI Scientist is then free to explore any
possible research direction. The template also includes a LaTeX folder that contains style files and
section headers, along with simple plotting code. We provide further details on the templates in
Section 6, but in general, each run starts with a representative small-scale experiment relevant to
the topic area. The focus on small-scale experiments is not a fundamental limitation of our method,
but simply for computational efficiency reasons and compute constraints on our end. We provide the
prompts for all stages in Appendix A.
1. Idea Generation. Givenastartingtemplate, The AI Scientist first“brainstorms”adiverseset
of novel research directions. We take inspiration from evolutionary computation and open-endedness
research (Brant and Stanley, 2017; Lehman et al., 2008; Stanley, 2019; Stanley et al., 2017) and
iterativelygrowanarchiveofideasusingLLMsasthemutationoperator(Faldoretal.,2024;Lehman
et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024). Each idea comprises a description, experiment
executionplan,and(self-assessed)numericalscoresofinterestingness,novelty,andfeasibility. Ateach
iteration,wepromptthelanguagemodeltogenerateaninterestingnewresearchdirectionconditional
ontheexistingarchive,whichcanincludethenumericalreviewscoresfromcompletedpreviousideas.
We use multiple rounds of chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022) and self-reflection (Shinn et al., 2024)
to refine and develop each idea. After idea generation, we filter ideas by connecting the language
model with the Semantic Scholar API (Fricke, 2018) and web access as a tool (Schick et al., 2024).
This allows The AI Scientist to discard any idea that is too similar to existing literature.
2. Experiment Iteration. Given an idea and a template, the second phase of The AI Scientist
first executes the proposed experiments and then visualizes its results for the downstream write-up.
The AI Scientist uses Aider to first plan a list of experiments to run and then executes them
in order. We make this process more robust by returning any errors upon a failure or time-out (e.g.
experiments taking too long to run) to Aider to fix the code and re-attempt up to four times.
After the completion of each experiment, Aider is then given the results and told to take notes in
the style of an experimental journal. Currently, it only conditions on text but in future versions, this
could include data visualizations or any modality. Conditional on the results, it then re-plans and
implements the next experiment. This process is repeated up to five times. Upon completion of
4
TheAIScientist:TowardsFullyAutomatedOpen-EndedScientificDiscovery
experiments, Aider is prompted to edit a plotting script to create figures for the paper using Python.
The AI Scientist makes a note describing what each plot contains, enabling the saved figures
and experimental notes to provide all the information required to write up the paper. At all steps,
Aider sees its history of execution.
Note that, in general, the provided initial seed plotting and experiment templates are small, self-
contained files. The AI Scientist frequently implements entirely new plots and collects new
metrics that are not in the seed templates. This ability to arbitrarily edit the code occasionally leads
to unexpected outcomes (Section 8).
3. Paper Write-up. The third phase of The AI Scientist produces a concise and informative
write-up of its progress in the style of a standard machine learning conference proceeding in LaTeX.
We note that writing good LaTeX can even take competent human researchers some time, so we take
several steps to robustify the process. This consists of the following:
(a) Per-Section Text Generation: The recorded notes and plots are passed to Aider, which is
prompted to fill in a blank conference template section by section. This goes in order of
introduction, background, methods, experimental setup, results, and then the conclusion (all
sections apart from the related work). All previous sections of the paper it has already written
are in the context of the language model. We include brief tips and guidelines on what each
section should include, based on the popular “How to ML Paper” guide, and include details in
Appendix A.3. At each step of writing, Aider is prompted to only use real experimental results in
theformofnotesandfiguresgeneratedfromcode,andrealcitationstoreducehallucination. Each
section is initially refined with one round of self-reflection (Shinn et al., 2024) as it is being
written. Aiderispromptedtonotincludeanycitationsinthetextatthisstage,andfillinonlya
skeleton for the related work, which will be completed in the next stage.
(b) Web Search for References: In a similar vein to idea generation, The AI Scientist is
allowed 20 rounds to poll the Semantic Scholar API looking for the most relevant sources to
compare and contrast the near-completed paper against for the related work section. This
process also allows The AI Scientist to select any papers it would like to discuss and
additionally fill in any citations that are missing from other sections of the paper. Alongside
each selected paper, a short description is produced of where and how to include the citation,
which is then passed to Aider. The paper’s bibtex is automatically appended to the LaTeX file to
guarantee correctness.
(c) Refinement: After the previous two stages, The AI Scientist has a completed first draft,
but can often be overly verbose and repetitive. To resolve this, we perform one final round of
self-reflection section-by-section, aiming to remove any duplicated information and streamline
the arguments of the paper.
(d) Compilation: Once the LaTeX template has been filled in with all the appropriate results, this
is fed into a LaTeX compiler. We use a LaTeX linter and pipe compilation errors back into Aider
so that it can automatically correct any issues.
4. Automated Paper Reviewing
An LLM Reviewer Agent. A key component of an effective scientific community is its reviewing
system, which evaluates and improves the quality of scientific papers. To mimic such a process using
large language models, we design a GPT-4o-based agent (OpenAI, 2023) to conduct paper reviews
based on the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference review guidelines. The
review agent processes the raw text of the PDF manuscript using the PyMuPDF parsing library. The
output contains numerical scores (soundness, presentation, contribution, overall, confidence), lists of
weaknesses and strengths as well as a preliminary binary decision (accept or reject). These decisions

1. Introduction
Automated scientific discovery empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered considerable
attentioninrecentyears(Cornelioetal.,2023;Giletal.,2014;Kingetal.,2009;Kitano,2021;Wang
et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2021). The development of end-to-end frameworks capable of autonomously
formulatinghypotheses,performingexperiments,analyzingresults,andauthoringmanuscriptscould
fundamentally transform the scientific process. A notable recent advance in this direction is The AI
Scientist-v1 (Lu et al., 2024), which demonstrated the feasibility of a fully automated scientific

stages by integrating a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based feedback mechanism, improving the
quality, clarity, and alignment of generated figures, captions, and text interpretation. To rigorously
evaluate the capabilities and limitations of fully autonomous manuscript generation, we conducted
a controlled experiment: three manuscripts entirely generated by The AI Scientist-v2 were
submitted to a peer-reviewed workshop at ICLR. Remarkably, one manuscript achieved an average
reviewer score of 6.33 (placing it roughly in the top 45% of submissions) and would have been
accepted after meta-review were it human-generated, thus becoming the first fully AI-generated
manuscript to successfully pass a peer-review process.
The accepted paper investigates whether incorporating an explicit compositional regularization term
intoneuralnetworktrainingcanimprovecompositionalgeneralization. Specifically,itpenalizeslarge
deviations between embeddings of successive time steps in sequence models, hypothesizing that
this encourages compositionality. The approach is evaluated using synthetic arithmetic expression
datasets, but it is found that compositional regularization does not yield significant improvements
and occasionally harms performance. The workshop reviewers appreciated the paper for clearly
identifying the challenges of effective compositional regularization and reporting on negative results.
However, they collectively highlighted shortcomings, including insufficient justification and intuitive
explanationsforwhythechosenregularizationmethodwouldenhancecompositionality. Ourpersonal
assessment (detailed further in §4) highlights several additional potential improvements in method
description(e.g.,makingclearexactlywhichcomponentofthenetworkisbeingregularized),potential
dataset overlap issues, and inaccuracies in figure captions. Overall, reviewers viewed the paper as an
interestingandtechnicallysoundworkshopcontributionthatneedsfurtherdevelopmentandbroader
experimentation to reach conference-level rigor.
This report provides an in-depth outline of the developed methodological advances, analysis of the
workshop-submitted papers, and a discussion on the ethical and safety considerations of systems like
The AI Scientist-v2. Our overall contributions are as follows:
1. Weintroduce The AI Scientist-v2,anautomatedscientificdiscoveryframeworkenhanced

improves the autonomy, flexibility, and scientific exploration depth of previous systems.
2. We demonstrate, for the first time, that an AI-generated manuscript can successfully pass peer
review at a recognized machine learning workshop, marking a critical milestone for AI science.
3. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluations and analyses of both peer-review feedback and
our system’s outputs, providing insights into the strengths, weaknesses, and current status of
AI-generated manuscripts relative to traditional human-authored scientific publications.
4. We open-source the full codebase for The AI Scientist-v2 and the ICLR 2025 workshop

Figure 1 | The AI Scientist-v2 Workflow. The workflow consists of several phases covering
automated idea generation, experiment execution, figure visualization, manuscript writing, and
reviewing. Unlike the initial version, The AI Scientist-v2 removes the dependency on human-
coded templates. Instead, it employs agentic tree search (managed by an Experiment Progress
Manager across several stages, orange) to generate and refine code implementations. Subsequent
experimentation leverages the best-performing code checkpoints (nodes) from the tree search to
iteratively test various research hypotheses.
2. Background
The AI Scientist-v1 (Luetal.,2024)introducedthefirstAIsystemthatentirelyautomatesscien-
tificdiscoveryandthepresentationofitsresults. Givenabaselinecodetemplate,itautonomouslywrote
code, executed experiments, visualized outcomes, and produced a complete scientific manuscript.
However, despite representing a significant step forward, The AI Scientist-v1 was subject to
limitations. Foremost among these was its reliance on human-crafted baseline code templates, signifi-
cantly constraining its autonomy and hindering unconstrained out-of-the-box deployability. Instead,
human effort was still required to draft an initial base experiment outline in code. Additionally, the
experimentation process followed a strictly linear hypothesis-testing routine, limiting depth and
exploration flexibility, especially when addressing complex research questions.
Language Model Agent Scaffolding. To further enhance LLM performance on complex reasoning
tasks, researchers have developed agentic scaffolding frameworks, each with distinct advantages
and limitations. For example, Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2024) enables models to iteratively reflect
on previous responses, encouraging self-improvement through critical evaluation of past outputs;
it improves robustness, but can introduce computational overhead and slower inference. Another
promising direction is the integration of tree-search strategies with LLMs (Jiang et al., 2025), allow-
ing structured exploration of reasoning paths. This approach enhances systematic reasoning and
comprehensiveness, though at the cost of increased complexity, higher computational demands, and
challenges in scalability.
Tree Search with Large Language Models. We empirically observed that automated research
conducted by The AI Scientist-v1 often resulted in short-sighted experimentation. The human-
driven scientific process, on the other hand, relies on open-ended hypothesis generation, stepping-
stone collection, and iterative hypothesis refinement. Recent advances using code generation as
an action space have opened new opportunities for LLM-driven automated workflows (Wang et al.,
2024). AIDE (Jiang et al., 2025) combines LLM-based code generation with tree search, demon-
3
The AI Scientist-v2:Workshop-LevelAutomatedScientificDiscoveryviaAgenticTreeSearch
strating state-of-the-art performance on the MLEBench benchmark (Chan et al., 2025), designed for
machine learning engineering tasks. In AIDE, each node represents a potential solution state with a
corresponding scalar evaluation score (e.g., validation accuracy). Nodes are iteratively selected for
further debugging or refinement based on these scores. Inspired by this approach, we integrate a
similar tree search-based exploration strategy within our automated scientific discovery framework,
adaptingitspecificallytothemulti-stagenatureofscientificexperimentation,asdetailedin§3.
3. The AI Scientist-v2
We now describe the major innovations introduced in The AI Scientist-v2 relative to The AI
Scientist-v1 (Lu et al., 2024). The most significant improvement is the move towards greater
autonomy and generalization, starting a more general idea generation phase (§3.1) and eliminating
the reliance on fixed, human-authored template code for experimentation. This process begins with
generalized idea generation, producing an initial concept, which then feeds into the experimentation
phase (§3.2). To manage this, we introduce two critical features in the experimentation phase:
coarse-grained experiment management and agentic tree search-based exploration. Additionally, we
integrate Vision Language Models (VLMs) into the experimental and review phases (§3.4). Finally,
we streamline the manuscript writing phase by replacing the incremental, Aider-based (Gauthier,
2024) iterative writing approach of The AI Scientist-v1 with a simpler, single-pass generation
followed by a separate reflection stage powered by reasoning models such as o1 (OpenAI, 2024). We
includeafulllistofsamplinghyperparametersandmodelsusedinAppendixAandthepromptsused
for The AI Scientist-v2 in Appendix B.
3.1. More General Idea Generation
A key conceptual shift in The AI Scientist-v2 is the approach to research idea generation.
Unlike the predecessor system, which primarily focused on proposing incremental modifications or
extensionsbasedonanexistingcodebase, The AI Scientist-v2 adoptsaprocessthatbeginsata
higher level of abstraction. The system is prompted to engage in more open-ended thinking about
potential research directions, hypotheses, and experimental designs, akin to formulating a research
abstract or grant proposal before committing to a specific implementation.
This approach encourages the exploration of potentially more novel or foundational ideas, rather
than being constrained by the structure and topics of pre-existing code. It aligns more closely with
howresearchersoftendevelopbroaderresearchvisions,startingwithabstractconceptsandassessing
novelty and feasibility before diving into specific implementations. Crucially, this generalized idea
generationphaseintegratesliteraturereviewtools,suchasSemanticScholar,intheloop. Thesystem
can query the literature database during the idea formulation process to assess the novelty of a
proposed concept and identify relevant prior work. This allows for more informed decisions about
pursuingaparticularresearchavenue,ensuringideasaregroundedintheexistingscientificlandscape
from the outset, rather than relying solely on post-hoc checks.
3.2. Removing Template Dependency
Following the improved idea generation phase, The AI Scientist-v2 proceeds with experimen-
tation. Beyond the code-conditioned idea generation, The AI Scientist-v1 also depended on
the predefined template code as a starting baseline implementation. The LLM-driven code changes
were then limited to sequential code adaptations. We now outline our strategy for eliminating this
limitation, thus improving the system’s flexibility and autonomy.
3.2.1. Experiment Progress Manager
Real-worldscientificexperimentationtypicallyproceedsthroughdistinctstages,frominitialfeasibility
assessments to detailed ablation analyses. To emulate this structured approach, we introduce an
4
The AI Scientist-v2:Workshop-LevelAutomatedScientificDiscoveryviaAgenticTreeSearch
experiment progress manager agent that coordinates four clearly defined stages of scientific
experimentation:
Stage 1 PreliminaryInvestigation: Establishinginitialfeasibilityandcorrectnessthroughaminimal
working prototype based on the generated research idea.
Stage 2 Hyperparameter Tuning: Refining the initial implementation by optimizing critical hyper-
parameters (e.g., learning rate, epochs) to create a robust experimental baseline.
Stage 3 Research Agenda Execution: Systematically implementing the core research agenda based
on the tuned baseline.
Stage 4 Ablation Studies: Systematically assessing the importance of various research components,
providing rigorous support for the main experimental findings.
Each stage has explicit stopping criteria. Stage 1 concludes when a basic working prototype is
successfully executed. Stage 2 ends when experiments stabilize, as indicated by convergence in
training curves and successful execution across at least two datasets. Stages 3 and 4 conclude when
the allocated computational budget is exhausted. Stage 3 also includes a check for experiment
duration–ifrunsfinishmuchfasterthanthepre-allocatedruntime,thesystemsuggestsincreasingthe
complexity of experiments.
After each stage, the experiment manager selects the best-performing node using a dedicated LLM
evaluator (see next section) based on clearly articulated criteria. This selected node is then carried
forwardtoseedthesubsequentexperimentationstage. Themanageralsorecordscheckpointsateach
stage’s completion. To ensure scientific rigor and reproducibility, the experiment manager launches
multiple replications of the selected best experiments at the conclusion of each stage. These repeated
runs provide statistics (mean and standard deviation) for figures and reported results.
3.2.2. Parallelized Agentic Tree Search
The AI Scientist-v1 operated strictly linearly, where each code refinement directly built on
the immediately preceding experiment. In contrast, The AI Scientist-v2 adopts a significantly
more flexible and exploratory approach inspired by recent successes in integrating tree search with
LLM-drivenworkflows(Chanetal.,2025;Jiangetal.,2025;Wijketal.,2024)andresearchonopen-
endedness(Clune,2019;MouretandClune,2015). Weincorporatethisagentictreesearchapproach
across all four experimentation stages outlined in §3.2.1, enabling deeper and more systematic
exploration of scientific hypotheses.
Each experimental node within our tree-based framework undergoes the following execution cycle:
An LLM first generates both a concrete experimentation plan and the associated Python code to
implement the experiment. The generated code is immediately executed in a Python interpreter.
If execution encounters an error, the error message is recorded, and the node is marked as buggy,
ending the current execution cycle for that node. If execution succeeds, the experiment proceeds to
the plotting phase.
During each experiment, the system is instructed to save all relevant experimental outputs (training
and validation metrics, losses, etc.) into structured numpy files. In the plotting phase, The AI
Scientist-v2 reads these stored results and the code, generating visualizations that summarize
and illustrate the findings clearly. These visualizations are subsequently passed to a Vision-Language
Model (VLM) for critique. Any issues flagged by the VLM (such as unclear labels, missing legends, or
misleading visualizations) result in the node being marked as buggy, and this feedback is recorded
for future debugging. Nodes that successfully execute and pass the VLM review without issue are
designated as non-buggy.
We define each node as a collection comprising an experiment script (e.g., a Python file), a textual
